                      There's no better place to lose yourself in nature than in
                      springtime New Hampshire. As serene and beautiful as it
                      was in the 1700s, this state is still much less traveled
                      than its neighbors to the South. So enjoy it while it

                      From the college capital of Columbus to the clean
                      coastline of Cleveland, Ohio is a truly hidden gem.
                      Earthquakes are surprisingly common in this particular
                      region of North America, over 200 of which have registered
                      with a magnitude of 2 or higher since 1776. However,
                      earthquakes aren't the only thing shaking this centrally
                      located state. One of the country's largest and oldest
                      roller coaster parks is waiting to ROCK your world in
                      Sandusky, Ohio! This will presumably be one of the most
                      thrilling quests you'll ever complete (provided you can
                      stomach it). Take a much-deserved break to ride as many
                      roller coasters as you can before continue your bike ride!
